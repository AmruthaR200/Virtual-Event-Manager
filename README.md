# Virtual-Event-Manager
# Front-End Only

Concept of the project:

The Virtual Event Planner Platform is a comprehensive online tool designed to empower event planners, organizers, and attendees to minimize the environmental impact of virtual events. By calculating and tracking carbon footprint and sustainability metrics, offering actionable recommendations, and providing sustainable event planning tools and resources, the platform makes eco-friendly practices and behaviors effortless, accessible, and efficient. It facilitates virtual event execution and management, ensuring a seamless experience while prioritizing environmental responsibility, and addresses a critical need in the event industry as the world shifts towards virtual events, shaping a more sustainable future, one virtual event at a time.

Problem Statement:

Design and develop a sustainable virtual event planner platform that reduces carbon footprint, increases accessibility, and promotes sustainable practices, supporting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and empowering event organizers, attendees, and sponsors to make a positive impact on the environment.

Objective of the Project:

1. Reduce carbon footprint: Help event organizers reduce their carbon footprint by providing a virtual event planning platform.
2. Promote sustainability: Encourage sustainable practices among event organizers, attendees, and sponsors.
3. Increase accessibility: Make events more accessible to a wider audience by providing a virtual platform.
4. Improve engagement: Enhance attendee engagement through interactive virtual features.
5. Support UN SDGs: Contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 13 (Climate Action).
6. Provide education and awareness: Offer resources and workshops on sustainable event planning and climate action.
7. Foster community: Create a community of sustainable event planners and attendees.
8. Continuously improve: Regularly update and improve the platform to ensure it remains sustainable and effective.


Data sources used:

1. Carbon footprint calculators (e.g. Carbon Footprint API, EPA's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator)
2. Sustainability reporting frameworks (e.g. GRI, CDP, SASB)
3. Virtual event platform APIs (e.g. Zoom, Google Meet, Skype)
4. Energy consumption and emissions data from utilities and energy providers
5. Transportation and travel data (e.g. flight emissions, public transportation usage)
6. Waste management and recycling data
7. Sustainable event planning resources and best practices (e.g. ISO 20121, Events Industry Council)
8. Attendee and speaker data (e.g. travel information, dietary preferences)
9. Venue and accommodation sustainability data (e.g. energy efficiency, waste reduction)
10. Government and NGO reports on sustainability and environmental impact
11. Industry benchmarks and research studies on sustainable events
12. Real-time energy usage and emissions data from event venues and accommodations


Features:

1. Calculates carbon footprint.
2. Tracks sustainability metrics.
3. Provides personalized recommendations.
4. Offers sustainable event planning tools.
5. Integrates with virtual event platforms.
6. Monitors energy usage and waste.
7. Supports sustainable catering and F&B options.
8. Encourages attendee engagement and feedback.
9. Provides education and training resources.
10. Recognizes and certifies sustainable events.


Methodology:

The Virtual Event Planner collects data on virtual event sustainability metrics, such as energy consumption and waste generation. It then calculates the carbon footprint of virtual events using this data. The platform tracks and reports on key sustainability metrics, comparing them to industry benchmarks to identify areas for improvement. Based on this analysis, it provides personalized sustainability recommendations to event planners. The platform supports event planners in implementing these recommendations and tracks their progress over time. Through continuous updates and refinements, the platform ensures its methods and recommendations stay current and effective. Additionally, it engages with stakeholders to raise awareness about sustainable event practices and offers education and training to support behavior change. Finally, it recognizes and certifies events that meet sustainability criteria, incentivizing event planners to adopt sustainable practices.

Probable Outcome:

1. Virtual events will have a lower carbon footprint.
2. Events will become more sustainable and reduce waste.
3. Costs will be reduced due to less travel and venue rental.
4. Events and organizations will gain a reputation for sustainability.
5. Attendees will have a better experience through virtual events.
6. Data will inform sustainable event planning decisions.
7. The event industry will adopt sustainable practices widely.
8. Virtual events will increase attendee engagement.
9. New business opportunities will emerge in sustainable event planning.
10. Virtual events will help achieve global sustainability goals.
